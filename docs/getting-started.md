# Introduction to working in the Nosana Programs repository ðŸŽŠ

The Nosana Programs repository uses different tools to compile, test and deploy the Nosana Programs
to Solana.

This doc should set you up with a local development environment.

## Anchor

The [Anchor](https://github.com/project-serum/anchor) framework is used to develop and build the Solana programs.
To get started, see the [guide](https://book.anchor-lang.com/getting_started/getting_started.html).

### Wallet

The default wallet location is set be located in `~/.config/solana/id.json`.
When you like to use a different location use the flag `--provider.wallet`, and do not change the `Anchor.toml`.

### Build

```
anchor build
```

The `--verifiable` flag could be used before deploying so that your build artifacts can be deterministically generated
with docker.

### Test

When testing locally, be sure to build with disabled feature "mainnet" to enable the testing IDs. You can do this by
editing `programs/nosana_commmons/Cargo.toml` and commenting the default feature set line.

```
anchor test
```

### Verify

To verify the program deployed on Solana matches your local source code, change directory into the program you want to
verify, e.g., `cd program`, and run

```bash
anchor verify -d projectserum/build:v0.22.1 --provider.cluster $CLUSTER nosJhNRqr2bc9g1nfGDcXXTXvYUmxD4cVwy2pMWhrYM
```

A list of build artifacts can be found in gitlab cicd.

### Upgrade

To upgrade a deployed program, configure your CLI to the desired network/wallet and run.

```bash
anchor upgrade --program-id $PROGRAM_ID --provider.cluster $CLUSTER target/deploy/$PROGRAM_NAME.so
```

To upgrade an IDL

```bash
anchor idl upgrade -f target/idl/$PROGRAM_NAME.json --provider.cluster $CLUSTER $PROGRAM_ID
```

### Publish

To publish the

### Initial Migration

After deployment for the first time, you must point your `anchor.toml` file to the network you've deployed to and run

```bash
anchor migrate
```

This will call the `initialize` method to create the token vaults. No specific calling key is needed - it can be called
by anyone, and is a once only operation for PDA vault creation. Subsequent runs will fail.

Any problems in this process can be triaged in the `migrations/deploy.js` file, which is what `anchor migrate` executes.
